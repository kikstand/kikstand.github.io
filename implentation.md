Our implementation services and record of successful implementations sets us apart. Leveraging all of the tools and a dynamic approach to leading project teams, we deliver our projects on time, on budget and typically with a happy team. Our goal is always to deliver the project successfully, while helping each project team member grow, at least a little, as project participants and task managers. We specialize in complex project turnarounds, taking lost opportunity and typically large financial and organizational energy investments and turning them into a successful project that delivers value to the stakeholders.

Kikstand is able to efficiently leverage our extensive knowledge and project experience working with the complex and diverse web of data sources, structures, stores and formats that exist within most organizations, to deliver high value, high impact solutions in the Business Intelligence, CRM and ERP arena. We are able to draw on experience with a wide array of technologies to develop and/or improve existing solutions to literally transform businesses by getting the right data to the right people in the right timeframe.

Drawing on our depth of knowledge and industry experience, we are able to provide Agile Development Process Coaching and Direction, Offshore Operations Optimization and Software Development Leadership Coaching.
