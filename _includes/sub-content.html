        The team at Kikstand has a truly extensive command of the various disciplines required to build and deliver software products and manage onshore and offshore teams.
        <br><br>
        They are able to use that knowledge working directly with development teams, as well as communicating strategies and concepts to non-technical audiences.
        <br><br>
        In working with them I have been impressed with their ability to tackle complex, abstract technical problems, model an approach to those problems, and then work with the team to fill in the solution.
