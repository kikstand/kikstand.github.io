Within our information technology strategy development specialty, we develop and implement leading-edge and cost-sensitive information technology (IT) strategies, providing tools to facilitate communications and providing project management and leadership for applications and infrastructure initiatives.

Our due diligence and assessment work often pairs with follow-on projects to develop strategic plans, post-acquisition integration and/or transition plan and information technology and business plan realignments.

With extensive industry experience in all phased software development, customer implementations and development mythologies, we can rapidly access development teams and projects and provide an accurate and detailed independent verification and validation. Our emphasis here is always on whether the process is working and the suitability of the process for the environment, rather than on any kind of “process purity” metrics. Knowing where a project or team is at is only part of the story, Kikstand delivers the next layer of value through development of time-phased, actionable strategic plans.

Depending on the depth and capabilities of the management team and the internal staff, we can provide a vCTO to lead these initiatives. Working with technical staff, executive teams and outside vendors, typically on a 6-to-12-month, fixed monthly fee contract, the Kikstand vCTO fills the role of a classical CIO and/or CTO.

With the rush to internet-based application and services delivery on shared-vendor managed infrastructure (Cloud applications), we are seeing much broader appeal for the vCTO. With many companies moving to various outsourcing models there is less day-to-day staff, equipment and process management to justify a full-time CT/IO. At the same time, integration, vendor management and strategic alignment issues loom large for these organizations. The perfect fit for an interim or long-term engagement of a Kikstand vCTO.
