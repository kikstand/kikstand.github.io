A Virtual CTO is like having high level technical consultant on demand.  In a business, the CTO is an executive position in charge of guiding the information technology strategy and the computer systems the company needs to grow and excel. Our clients get direct access to our decades of knowledge and experience in technology to help them make smart business decisions.

## Virtual CTO

Smart IT decisions are just as important for small businesses as they are for a massive enterprise. In fact, a wrong turn or unmitigated threat can cripple a company that relies on business technology to get work done. 

The CTO is the organizationâ€™s senior technologist, responsible for overseeing current technology assets, and more important, for developing a technology vision for the organization. Most small businesses and non-profits have little need for this position as a full-time executive, but when you're talking about an investment in technology, the lack of someone in this role can be detrimental, strategically and monetarily.

A vCTO enables small and medium sized businesses (SMBs) to align their IT Strategic Plan with the overall Strategic Plan of the organization. Assisting you in the design, implementation, measurement and maintenance of all aspects of your IT systems to ensure that IT systems are functioning with the maximum performance, accuracy, reliability, and availability.

## Virtual CIO
Enabling you to address your IT needs without the risk or expense of hiring another employee. A vCIO is the perfect solution for a variety scenarios, from allowing you to maintain operations and manage technical staff on an interim basis; to managing specific IT projects, such as software conversions, facilities build-outs, web and e-business initiatives, voice and data upgrades and acquisition business process integration.
